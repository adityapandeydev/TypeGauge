# TypeGauge

TypeGauge is a project inspired by the popular typing game [TypeRacer](https://play.typeracer.com/). This initial build focuses on learning and implementing state management in a React environment. The UI is currently a direct replication of the TypeRacer site, serving as a starting point for further enhancements. 

## 🚧 Project Status

This project is in its **early stages** of development. It is primarily a learning exercise to explore state management techniques in React. The UI, functionality, and features are subject to significant changes in future iterations.

## 🌟 Features

- **Typing Challenge**: The current build implements basic typing challenge functionality.
- **State Management**: Learnings and implementation of state management techniques.

## 🛠️ Future Enhancements

Planned improvements for the project include:

- Custom UI design to replace the copied elements from TypeRacer.
- Improved state management solutions.
- Additional features such as multiplayer typing races, user authentication, and leaderboards.
- Responsive design for better usability on different devices.

## 📚 Learning Goals

The primary objective of this project is to deepen understanding of React concepts, particularly state management. This includes:

- Managing state across components.
- Using React context or external libraries (e.g., Redux, Zustand) for state management.

## ⚠️ Acknowledgements

The current UI is heavily inspired by the [TypeRacer](https://play.typeracer.com/) website. This design is used purely for educational purposes and will be replaced in future updates with original designs.
